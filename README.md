## Chapter 1 - Transformer models
### Working with pipelines:
- The most basic object in the 🤗 Transformers library is the pipeline() function. It connects a model with its necessary preprocessing and postprocessing steps, allowing us to directly input any text and get an intelligible answer.
- There are three main steps involved when you pass some text to a pipeline:
  1. The text is preprocessed into a format the model can understand.
  2. The preprocessed inputs are passed to the model.
  3. The predictions of the model are post-processed, so you can make sense of them.
- Some of the currently available pipelines are:
  1. feature-extraction (get the vector representation of a text)
  2. fill-mask
  3. ner (named entity recognition)
  4. question-answering
  5. sentiment-analysis
  6. summarization
  7. text-generation
  8. translation
  9. zero-shot-classification
- You can see basic use of pipelines [here](working-with-pipelines.ipynb)
